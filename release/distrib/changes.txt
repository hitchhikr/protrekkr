  and they won't jump back to the top after a saving one either.
- Fixed a bug in Pattern loop command (6).
- Splitted the play button into 2, 1st one to play song,
  2nd one to play pattern, right mouse button on those to play song
  or pattern from current row (using left mouse button starts from top row).

  on a track which is currently auto fading won't stop the fading process
  which now have to be switched off by using either 1700 or 1800.

  loaded while a song being played (& playing that particular instrument).
- Fixed the random commands of the 303 units.
- 303 notes up & down commands were inverted.

v1.98f:

- Removed the .ptp loading function from the tracker, it's useless now as
  packed samples can be tested inside the tracker and it allowed me to slightly
  reduce the size of the replay routine.
- Instrument weren't played when the option i added in the previous version
  wasn't turned on (shame).
- Application directory was one level too low on Mac OS X.

- Added an option to paste blocks across patterns boundaries
  (if the blocks is too big it'll be pasted over the next pattern 
   but only if it's a different one to avoid wrapping around).
- Created a new directory (patterns) and added an option to save current pattern
  selections into it (.ppb files) (Shortcut: LCTRL+W)
  (303 patterns are also saved into that directory).
- Files are now saved into their respective directories.
- Added some visual indicators to show if copy buffers are empty or not.

  of OSC_1 or OSC_2.

  **Due to this older modules don't sound exactly the same**

  64, 88, 96, 128, 160 & 192 kbps.
- LSHIFT+I: Show instruments list / LSHIFT+S: Show synths list.
- Forgot to include LameACM.inf in the windows distribution
  (without that file the codec couldn't be installed
   and samples using mp3 packing scheme weren't packed at all, shame).
- Added At3 samples packing scheme (Windows users need to install
  the atrac3 codec located in the install directory in order to pack samples).
  Rates are: 66, 105 & 132 kbps (depacker not yet implemented on PSP, tho).
- Added the ability to select a range of positions for songs rendering to .wav.
- The nasty click occuring when loading a module while another one
  was still playing should be gone.

- Cubic interpolation can now be disabled
  (should increase speed a bit but at the expense of lower quality).
- Added ADPCM packing scheme.

  in the tracker. (unpacked versions of the instruments are kept safe
  and are saved in .ptk files as usual).

  (also changed the font so patterns should be a bit easier to read now).
- Added volume ramping for the 303 units.
- The 2nd 303 unit wasn't triggered correctly.

v1.94:

- Fixed a nasty memory leak in the PSP replay
  (also only necessary data are now allocated).
- Space char wasn't available during names input.
- Added effects 41 and 42 to control the volumes of the 2 303 units.

- Resampler improved, should produce much less aliasing.
- Fixed a small issue involving the cache memory in the PSP replay.

v1.92b:

- Added an option to show or hide the bottom panel in order to display
  more patterns rows (Shortcut: LSHIFT+ESCAPE to toggle the view)
- Left shift wasn't active while editing data columns
  of patterns to enter digits.

v1.92:

- Added global lists for instruments and synths,
  that should improve the ergonomy a bit.
- Samples weren't re-initiliazed correctly after a "New Module" command
  was issued.
- Fixed a bug in the 2nd oscillator of the synth core
  when using custom waveforms.

v1.91b:

- Fixed the rand commands in the synth tab.

- Introduced zoomed tracks; Each track can be zoomed independantly
  and will be displayed with a bigger font.
- Track volume wasn't correctly re-initialized when only instrument column
  was filled without any note.

v1.90e:

- Midi notes off command was broken.
- Effect 0Axx (Set Random Cutoff) slightly modified, the xx value is now
  the amplitude of the calculated random value from 0 to ff.

v1.90d:

- Implemented midi in/out for Linux and Mac OS X.

v1.90c:

- Fixed a bug in the recording mode.
- Recording now starts at the current pattern line instead of restarting
  from it's beginning.

v1.90b:

- An extra note was pasted after names input when editing mode was turned on.

v1.90:

- Added a scrollbar beside patterns.
- The tracker can now load all these .wav file formats (mono or stereo) :
  - 8-bit integer.
  - 12-bit integer.
  - 16-bit integer.
  - 24-bit integer.
  - 32-bit integer.
  - 32-bit float.
  - 64-bit float.
- Added an option to render a module as 32 bit (float) .wav file.
- Inverted the right and left mouse buttons functions in patterns.
- Fixed an issue with the loop editor.
- Patterns now automatically scroll when using the right mouse button
  (also work when selecting a block).
- Added multi notes channels, they can be used to trigger several notes / track
  at the same time in order to make chords or to play several instruments
  in the same track and route them to the same row effect / dsp effect
  (thus allowing to considerably reduce the dsp usage and also introduce some
   modularity which could be useful, especially for the PSP replay).
  Note that these channels are shared with the polyphony ones.
- Improved volume ramping.
- Keys repeat was disabled when editing note columns.
- Added LCTRL+TAB and LCTRL+LSHIFT+TAB to cycle through the notes of a track.

v1.86b:

- Fixed a bug with the 303 data loading in the replay routine.
- Fx 0A (Set random cutoff) was disabled due to a typo in the fx constants.
- Added the first version of a replay routine for the PSP,
  
  It uses the 2nd processor so the main CPU time occupation is really minimal.
  
  Keep in mind that this is an experiment and that this console isn't a PC
  so you'd better go very easy on the dsp effects and channels polyphony,
  especially the flanger is a really heavy toll because the media engine
  doesn't have any integrated hardware sin/cos or pow instructions.

  Samples depacking with the PSP codecs isn't implemented yet
  (so samples packing should be set to "none" in that case).

v1.86:

- Fixed a bug with channels that could be heard faintly even when being muted
  (was also present in wav rendering).
- Channels polyphony (up to 16) implemented.

- Switching to FX Setup tab produced a small sound glitch
  due to a re-generation of the reverb buffers.
- Added C-masters.ptk by Rhino.
- Keyboard polyphony improved (notes don't "spread" on other tracks).
- Removed some clicks due to channels filters.
- Fixed a bug in .ptk depacking process which could lead to a crash.

v1.83c:

- Added Arpeggio effect (1B):
  It's behaviour is a bit different than from other trackers, example:
  
  C-7 00 .. .. 1B37 <- Turn it on
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 1B38 <- Change data
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000

- Fixed a bug in ADSR release for waveforms.

v1.0b:

- Fixed a small bug with channels on/off status in the replay.
- Fixed a bug when using the mouse wheel on the sequencer.
