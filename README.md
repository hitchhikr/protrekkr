ProTrekkr is a tracker program combining a software synthesizer together with
a traditional samples tracker which can (mainly) be used to create electronic music
(like psytrance, trance goa, hard acid, IDM, chip, techno, jungle, etc.)
targeting small sized intros, demos or games.

It’s a heavily modified version of the old NoiseTrekker 2 which was made by
Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius aka Arguru.

Currently the tracker is available on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Amiga OS4, AROS, MorphOS, Mac OS (ppc, x86, ia64 & arm64) and Haiku OS.

---
In order to compile the tracker, use the provided makefile for your target architecture (if available).

Example:

make -f makefile.linux

The executable will be created in the release/distrib directory.

Notice that you'll need SDL 1.<br>
> [!CAUTION]
> **When compiling for Linux or Mac OS: Use libSDL12 and NOT libSDL12-compat.**

This is a FREEWARE tool, this means that you can use it for whatever you want and for free.
There's NO GUARANTEE that this program will perform well or even run on your computer.
